Practicing JavaScript: for, functions, .push, .includes().

I created this program to determine the user's preferred brand and verify if the given information is accurate. The program starts by asking the user to indicate their preferred brand. Next, it presents a list of brands and asks the user if they like each one. Whenever the answer is "No," the corresponding brand is added to a "disliked brands" list.

Finally, if the user's preferred brand is in that list, the program outputs "That doesn't make any sense," indicating that the initial information provided was not true.
